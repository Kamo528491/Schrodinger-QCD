# Schrodinger-QCD
Solving Schrodinger's equation for the QCD potential : this code can be adapted for any (1D) central effective potential and relies on finite element method to extract the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. This repository contains a .py file with the complete code, and a jupyter notebook with explanations on how to obtain the radial equation with a 1D central potential (using the example of perturbative QCD).
